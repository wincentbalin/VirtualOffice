# VirtualOffice Vagrant environment
 
 Easy-to-configure office Vagrant environment. Just copy the `Vagrantfile` to your documents directory, run it with `vagrant up` and login with `vagrant rdp` (using credentials _vagrant_/_vagrant_). 
 Then you will have the power of LibreOffice at your fingertips. The documents directory on your host is syncronised with the `Documents` directory on your guest system.
