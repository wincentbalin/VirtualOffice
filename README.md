# VirtualOffice Vagrant environment
 
 Easy-to-configure LibreOffice Vagrant environment with XFCE and RDP connexion. Just copy the `Vagrantfile` to your documents directory, run it with `vagrant up` and login with `vagrant rdp` using credentials _vagrant_/_vagrant_; upon your first login you will be asked whether you prefer a default or an empty XFCE panel. 
 Then you will have the power of LibreOffice at your fingertips. The documents directory on your host is synchronised with the `Documents` directory on your guest system. This project is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).
